# Smart-Class
A smart classroom project

On an average most students spend a large portion of their time in a lecture copying down what the teacher writes on the board. What if an application gave you a copy of everything written on the board leaving you with more time to jot down additional 
points?

The technologies used to implement this application are Android and NFC. A central server handles authentication for both the teacher and the students. It also maintains a database of registered students.

Let us say the teacher uses a pen tablet or Smartphone that supports handwriting, the display of which is projected on a screen. The teacher would be using the Smart Notes Android app for this purpose. This arrangement is analogous to a conventional blackboard. A student on entering the classroom swipes his NFC capable phone on the NFC tag/device present in the room. The following tasks are accomplished using NFC-
- Turning on the Wi-Fi and connecting to the default network.
- The Smart Notes Android application would be started and authentication done via the server (Only registered students for the course would be able to login )
- Mark the student’s attendance and put the phone in silent mode

In case of a successful login, the student would get a live feed of whatever the teacher writes using the Smart Notes App. The student can then edit/add to the content. But all these modifications would remain private to the student’s application. At the end of the lecture, the student can save these notes as in a suitable format at the path specified by him/her. 

Smart Notes App also has an added functionality wherein the teacher can view the attendance records of all the students in his class. Similarly, the student would be able to view his attendance in a monthly chart.

The advantages of using this application are as follows:
- Saves time that is spent in copying down notes from the board
- In case of large classrooms, this App would help the students get a clear picture of what the teacher is writing on the board
- Errors pertaining to noting down incorrectly from the board are eliminated
- Even on arriving late to the class, the student won’t miss out anything by being able to view the notes from the starting of the lecture itself
- NFC would help speedup starting up the Smart Notes App by performing mundane tasks of turning on Wi-Fi, connecting to an Access Point and authenticating the student on App as well as putting the phone in silent mode.
